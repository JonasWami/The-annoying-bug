On my birthday I went to see the beautiful gravestones behind
Glasgow Cathedral. Because of their age, their memorial carvings
had eroded and engulfed in moss. In the most extreme cases,
for the gravestones which were no longer being upkept, the sentences
had become completely unintelligable. 
It seemed interesting, how all of these writings, whose purpose are
to remind of the person burried there, were also slowly being lost
to time, dying, even if literally written stone.
I decided to create this 3-variant typeface pack based on how letters
decay in real gravestones.

Big thanks to Jenny for discovering the the stones first!
If it wasn’t for her, this project wouldn’t have happened! :)
